### How to run it:

### What to modify/where to put it
- For css stuff, put it in static folder under its respective directory, and reference it according to how it's done in index.html
- For html stuff, put it in the templates folder, as that's what Flask looks for and pulls from
- Any backend stuff just put it in app.py
