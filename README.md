# Tinder 4 BU

### How to run it:
- pip install flask
- cd to top level directory
- flask run

### What to modify/where to put it
- For css stuff, put it in the css folder and just refer to it accordingly in the html (this may be wrong, Flask might be some fancy stuff)
- For html stuff, put it in the templates folder, as that's what Flask looks for and pulls from
- Any backend stuff just put it in the index.py
