# Idea 1: Airdrop Spammer

This app will send random gifs based on your three (or less) most recent Tweets, using the Twitter API and Giphy APIs. The purpose of the project is to provide some shock therapy to the vast majority of us who leave bluetooth on and, subsequently, Airdrop. There have been many security concerns with Bluetooth in the past, and the addition of Airdrop as a feature only exacerbates that problem. Clearly, there needed to be a third party who could step in and remind people of the dangers of leaving themselves open to attackers. How will people be productive when they are constantly being spammed by gifs of cute animals or spooky math equations? The answer is simple: turn off Airdrop, and by doing so, also patch up a major hole in individual security bubbles. By using the Twitter API, we will also be able to use its oauth feature, preventing someone from writing a script that spins up a bunch of Airdrop spammers and crashes everyone's phones, patching up a potential security flaw in the app itself. It's a win-win for the user and the victims!
